# UI Systems and Complexity

This whitepaper explores complexity in building and maintaining [UI systems](#ui-systems).

The document opens with a reminder of the importance of modelling UI as a function of state, a concept that is widely understood and applied by most developers, while highlighting common negligence of such principles when managing styles and CSS.  A brief overview of design systems and a definition of UI systems is then naturally introduced.  While such systems serve as ways to manage complexity in UI development, the document presents an interactive story on how complexity becomes unavoidable irregardless of the well-intentioned choices we make at every point of the way.  The document argues that it is not "good" abstractions nor updating specs that will guard us from growing complexity, but an increased emphasis on applying [the Unix philosophy](#the-unix-philosophy) in building small, composable and interoperable programs, paired with tools and processes that improve our [system knowledge](#system-knowledge), that will allow us to iteratively make better decisions in managing complexity in UI systems.  The document ends with an exposition on [the `uinix` philosophy](#the-uinix-philosophy) as a way to remediate complexity in UI systems, accompanied with relevant links to [demos](#uinix-systems) and [references](#references).

This document contains *interactive* [React][react] code examples.  Feel free to edit the code appropriately in the editor to preview changes!

## view = f(s)

Modern declarative UI libraries, such as [React][react] emphasize the important concept of:

> View as a function of state.

This powerful model allows us to reason about building UIs as no more than writing and composing functions, as demonstrated in the next few sections.

### Simple functions

Here are some simple functions that we can compose:

```js live
() => {
  const greet = name => {
    return `Hi ${name}`;
  };

  const uppercase = x => {
    return x.toUpperCase();
  };

  const exclaim = x => x + '!!!';

  // shout(x) === exclaim(uppercase(greet(x)))
  const shout = pipe([
    greet,
    uppercase,
    exclaim,
  ]);

  return shout('Jesse Pinkman');
}
```

Feel free to edit the code on the right (e.g. change the piped functions in `shout`, or supply your own functions for composition).

### View functions

View functions, more commonly known as *components*, are simply functions!

```js live
() => {
  const Button = ({ text }) => {
    return <button>{text}</button>;
  };

  const Big = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <div style={{ transform: 'scale(3)', transformOrigin: 'top left' }}>
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  };

  const Red = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'white' }}>
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  };

  const BigRedButton = ({ text }) => {
    return (
      <Big>
        <Red>
          <Button text={text} />
        </Red>
      </Big>
    );
  };

  return <BigRedButton text="Boom!" />;
}
```

The above example uses the JSX syntax commonly used in [React][react], but components are just functions, so we should be able to compose them just as regular functions with a `pipe`.

To confirm this, you can update the <code><span style="color: red;">BigRedButton</span></code> in the earlier example with this vanilla JS code instead, and modify and experiment with the pipe accordingly.

```js
const attachChildren = (x) => ({ children: x }); // a helper to remap arguments into an object under the `children` property.

const BigRedButton = ({ text }) => {
  return pipe([
    Button,
    attachChildren,
    Red,
    attachChildren,
    Big,
  ])({ text });
}
```

<div>
  <code><span style="color: red;">BigRedButton</span></code> is just a function!
</div>

## style = f(s)

### Neglecting Styles and CSS

While the concept of function composition is well-understood by most people and is rigorously applied in all areas in UI development (components, APIs, state, utils, testing etc),

> Somewhere, somehow, and everytime, styles and CSS are left as an afterthought at best, and layers of overriding and duplicated logic in codebases at worst.

If you disagree on this, it is a simple experiment to see if you can collect all style declarations and their interactions and effects on components.  If you are able to do this, you have solved and mastered a commonly overlooked aspect of UI development, but the further sections may still interest you.

For the rest of us, we will begin to fallback on the argument that,

> "Our styles are closely organized with components and is, therefore, organized."

and continue to lie to ourselves that we are using the excuse of a private implementation to mask the fact that we are still duplicating and overriding external styles.  Perhaps we are all subconsciously influenced by the very nature of C(ascading)S(tyle)S(heets), and not actively aware that we do not make conscious efforts to modularize, organize and compose styles.

### Back to basics

Let's keep an open mind and go back to basics with a simple proposition that we can reason about

> Style as a function of state.

Revisiting our simple functions,

```js live
() => {
  const greet = name => {
    return `Hi ${name}`;
  };

  const uppercase = x => {
    return x.toUpperCase();
  };

  const exclaim = x => x + '!!!';

  // shout(x) === exclaim(uppercase(greet(x)))
  const shout = pipe([
    greet,
    uppercase,
    exclaim,
  ]);

  return shout('Jesse Pinkman');
}
```

### Style functions

Let's now try to model style declarations as either style objects or *style functions* returning style objects.  With the help of an [`Element`][element-component] component, we will assign these style functions to the `styles` prop and specify the data for these function in the `styleProps` prop.


```js live
() => {
  const styles = {
    button: { // a simple object
      borderRadius: '4px',
      border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
      paddingBottom: '4px',
      paddingLeft: '16px',
      paddingRight: '16px',
      paddingTop: '4px',
    },
    big: ({ isBig }) => { // a simple function
      return {
        fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : undefined,
        padding: isBig ? '32px 16px': undefined
      };
    },
    red: {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
      color: 'white',
    },
  };

  return (
    <Layout direction="column" spacing="l">
      <Element
        as="button"
        styles={styles.button}>
        Button
      </Element>
      <Element
        as="button"
        styleProps={{
          isBig: true,
        }}
        styles={styles.big}>
        Big
      </Element>
      <Element
        as="button"
        styles={styles.red}>
        Red
      </Element>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

Feel free to configure the `styleProps` in the editor or create new style definitions appropriately.

Just as components, and generally functions, can be composed, we will compose styles by simply piping multiple smaller style functions to the `styles` prop.  Details on how style composition is performed by the [`Element`][element-component] component will be left as a future reading in the [`uinix-ui`][uinix-ui] docs.

```js live
() => {
  const styles = {
    button: {
      borderRadius: '4px',
      border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
      paddingBottom: '4px',
      paddingLeft: '16px',
      paddingRight: '16px',
      paddingTop: '4px',
    },
    big: ({ isBig }) => {
      return {
        fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : undefined,
        padding: isBig ? '32px 16px': undefined
      };
    },
    red: {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
      color: 'white',
    },
  };

  return (
    <Layout direction="column" spacing="l">
      <Element
        as="button"
        styleProps={{
          isBig: true,
        }}
        styles={[
          styles.big,
          styles.red,
          styles.button,
        ]}>
        BigRedButton
      </Element>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

By going back to basics, we discovered that we can easily compose and organize styles as simple functions!  While it will take us time to shake off old habits and build new muscles, it is exciting to start treating style functions with the same respect as any other UI functions!

ðŸ’ª

## ui = f(s)

With style functions formally joining the family of simple and composable functions, an example UI project can be organized and might look like:

```sh
src
  components/
    ...
    big.js
    button.js
    red.js
  styles/
    ...
    big.js
    button.js
    red.js
  utils/
    ...
    exclaim.js
    greet.js
    uppercase.js
    shout.js
```

And we can continue to develop with the principle of

> UI as a function of state.

ðŸŽ‰

## Design Systems

The preceding sections describe the backbone on how to organize building blocks of code, but does not deal with the actual *decisions and choices* we make on what we are building and maintaining.

A [design system][design-system] serves as a source of truth for design decisions.  Design system frameworks and patterns are popularly utilized to help manage growing complexities of building applications.  The following is a list of well known design systems:

- [Material Design System][material-design-system]
<img src={materialDesignSystemImage} width="100%" />
- [Carbon][carbon-design-system]
<img src={carbonDesignSystemImage} width="100%" />
- [Ant][ant-design-system]
<img src={antDesignSystemImage} width="100%" />

It is important to note that every design system is different, not just in visuals and interactions, but in principles and approach.  These differences reflect the *decisions and choices* on how the system organizes design specs and rules.

## UI Systems

### Definition

The definition for UI systems is not formally established in the community, but we will provide a simple one:

> **UI System**: an implementation of a design system in code.

With this definition, the following UI systems implement their corresponding design systems,
- [`antd`][antd]: implements [Ant Design System][ant-design-system]
- [`carbon-components`][carbon-components]: implements [Carbon Design System][carbon-design-system]
- [`material-ui`][material-ui]: implements [Material Design System][material-design-system]

### UI System Libraries

It is also worthwhile to note that *UI system libraries* implement UI systems.  Examples of such libraries include:
- [`theme-ui`][theme-ui]
- [`uinix-ui`][uinix-ui]

## Entropy

As we further our discussions into systems, we will naturally talk about the entropy and complexity of systems.

Entropy is a measure of disorder.  In the natural world, the [second law of thermodynamics][second-law-of-thermodynamics] states that entropy can only remain unchanged or increase in a closed system.  [Software entropy][software-entropy] echoes this phenomenon on the development of closed software systems.  Relating back to design and UI systems, we should expect entropy to ineviatbly build up as we make changes to systems.

## Complexity

[Complexity][complexity], while not the same as entropy, can be measured by the total independent ways components in a system can interact with each other.  A complex system is commonly mislabelled to be complicated.  The former concept deals with a certain and quantifiable way to measure a system, but the latter concept deals with *human perception and imperfect knowledge* of the system.

We often say to ourselves,

> "This code is too complicated, and we need to refactor it."

But less often do we pause and reflect that the complicated code maybe due to our lack of understanding of the current system. We rarely possess complete [system knowledge](#system-knowledge), and should safely assume our knowledge and understanding of any system is imperfect at best.  In the best case scenarios, we make the right choices on limited knowledge and refactor code with meaningful abstractions.  In the worst case scenarios, we convince ourselves that our abstractions are well-formed, and unknowingly increase system complexity and future complications.

Personally, I like to view complexity in the following way:

> "Complexity is unavoidable because we have to make choices, and imperfect knowledge of systems contribute to undesired complexity, experienced by us as eventual complications in the system."

## Elliot and the Complexity Beast

This section borrows the format of an interactive story, and follows the quest of a frontend developer, Elliot, as he works on building UI components with his Design team.  At every point of implementation, he tries his best to thoughtfully reduce and manage complexity, only to find that he can never conquer complexity, but faces the eventual beast, one that has been shaped by the very choices made during the journey.

A quick reminder again that all code examples are *interactive*, so feel free to adjust the code as you follow Elliot on his journey!

### Hello Elliot

Elliot begins his journey with a simple [`Element`][element-component] rendering some text:

```js live
<Element>
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
</Element>
```

He receives initial design requirements to style it accordingly:

```js live
<Element
  styles={{
    borderRadius: '4px',
    border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
    padding: '4px 16px',
  }}>
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
</Element>
```

He then receives further requirements that this component should support conditional behaviors if it `isBig`.  He does so and implements it naturally in a simple way:

```js live
() => {
  return (
    <Element
      styleProps={{
        isBig: true,
      }}
      styles={({ isBig }) => ({
        borderRadius: '4px',
        border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
        fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : '14px',
        padding: isBig ? '16px 32px': '4px 16px',
      })}>
      The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    </Element>
  );
}
```

### `Danger`

A few days later, he receives another requirement to apply the red styles on this component:

```js live
() => {
  return (
    <Element
      styleProps={{
        isBig: true,
      }}
      styles={({ isBig }) => ({
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '4px',
        border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
        color: 'white',
        fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : '14px',
        padding: isBig ? '16px 32px': '4px 16px',
      })}>
      The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    </Element>
  );
}
```

He ships his simple component, and gives it a name `Danger`.  Everyone, including himself, loves it and is proud of his work!

### `Warning`

A few days later, he receives design requirements on a new component.  He's named the component `Warning` and here is the current implementation:

```js live
() => {
  return (
    <Element
      styles={{
        backgroundColor: '#ffe7ba',
        borderRadius: '6px',
        border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
        color: '#ff7a45',
        padding: '4px 16px',
      }}>
      The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    </Element>
  );
}
```

### `Notice`

He notices that `Danger` and `Warning` are very similar and can potentially share a common implementation.  He discusses it with his design team:

> **Elliot**: "Hey folks, it seems that the only differences between `Danger` and `Warning` are 1) differing `borderRadius` values, and 2) `Warning` does not support an `isBig` variant.  Can we confirm how we should reason about `Danger` and `Warning`?"
>
> **Design**: "The `borderRadius` for both components should be the same, that was probably an inconsistent mistake on our side, but `Warning` should never support an `isBig` variant."

Elliot goes back to the drawing board and thinks carefully how he implement the new requirements and paying careful attention to avoid duplication and reduce complexity.  Luckily, this seems easy enough:

```js live
() => {
  const variants = {
    'danger': {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
      color: 'white'
    },
    'warning': {
      backgroundColor: '#ffe7ba',
      color: '#ff7a45',
    },
  };

  const styles = {
    notice: ({ isBig, variant }) => ({
      borderRadius: '6px',
      border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
      fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : '14px',
      padding: isBig ? '16px 32px': '4px 16px',
      ...variants[variant],
    }),
  };

  return (
    <Layout direction="column" spacing="l">
      <Element
        styleProps={{
          isBig: true,
          variant: 'danger',
        }}
        styles={styles.notice}>
        Danger
      </Element>
      <Element
        styleProps={{
          variant: 'warning',
        }}
        styles={styles.notice}>
        Warning
      </Element>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

What Elliot has done is great so far:
- He was able to convince the Design team to reduce an unwanted degree of complexity by standardizing `borderRadius`.
- He was able to decouple and abstract styles as a function.
- The style function supports both needs of `Danger` and `Warning` appropriately.
- Both the Engineering and Design team can now reason about this design decision as a common component.

Elliot proudly names this component `Notice` and explains its behaviors to his team.  The Design team reviewed it and confirmed they loved the improvements!

### `BigRedButton`

A few days later, Elliot receives requirements to create a <code><span style="color: red;">BigRedButton</span></code>  component.  Here is his implementation:

```js live
() => {
  return (
    <Element
      as="button"
      styleProps={{
        isBig: true
      }}
      styles={({ isBig }) => ({
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '6px',
        border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
        color: 'white',
        fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : '14px',
        padding: isBig ? '32px 48px': '4px 16px',
      })}>
      BigRedButton
    </Element>
  );
}
```

He notices that it shares some aspects with the `Notice` component he created earlier.  Being the diligent and responsible developer, Elliot goes back to the drawing board to see how he can decouple and organize this code into smaller parts:

```js live
() => {
  const danger = {
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    color: 'white',
  };

  const warning = {
    backgroundColor: '#ffe7ba',
    color: '#ff7a45',
  }

  const big = ({ isBig }) => ({
    fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : '14px',
    padding: isBig ? '16px 32px': '4px 16px',
  });

  const variants = {
    danger,
    warning,
  };

  const styles = {
    big,
    danger,
    notice: ({ isBig, variant }) => ({
      borderRadius: '6px',
      border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
      ...variants[variant],
      ...big({ isBig }),
    }),
  };

  return (
    <Layout direction="column" spacing="l">
      <Element
        as="button"
        styleProps={{
          isBig: true
        }}
        styles={[
          styles.danger,
          styles.big,
        ]}>
        BigRedButton
      </Element>
      <Element
        styleProps={{
          variant: 'danger',
        }}
        styles={styles.notice}>
        Notice (Danger)
      </Element>
      <Element
        styleProps={{
          variant: 'warning',
        }}
        styles={styles.notice}>
        Notice (Warning)
      </Element>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

Studying the style functions, he sees an opportunity to further refactor and organize this meaningfully, by breaking out the `big` and `danger` styles to aid composition, so that they can be reused in <code><span style="color: red;">BigRedButton</span></code>  while leaving the exact same behaviors for `Notice`  He's following the exact recommendations that we've laid out in earlier sections on [`style = f(s)`](#style--fs)!

But little does he know, this innocent and well-intentioned choice, will be what awakens the sleeping Complexity Beast.

### `BigNotSoRedButton`

A few days later, the Design team comes back to Elliot and raises a non-negotiable change that <code><span style="color: red;">BigRedButton</span></code> is too red, and that <code><span style="color: #ff85c0;">BigNotRedButton</span></code>is what they had in mind to use.

Elliot, after days of successfully refactoring code, confidently heads to the drawing board again, and studies the relevant parts of his code:

```js live
() => {
  const danger = {
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    color: 'white',
  };

  const warning = ({ isBig }) => ({
    fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : '14px',
    padding: isBig ? '16px 32px': '4px 16px',
  });

  const notSoRed = {
    backgroundColor: '#ff85c0',
    color: 'white',
  };

  const big = ({ isBig }) => ({
    fontSize: isBig ? '32px' : '14px',
    padding: isBig ? '16px 32px': '4px 16px',
  });

  const styles = {
    big,
    danger,
    notSoRed,
  };

  return (
    <Layout direction="column" spacing="l">
      <Element
        as="button"
        styleProps={{
          isBig: true
        }}
        styles={[
          styles.notSoRed,
          styles.big,
        ]}>
        BigNotSoRedButton
      </Element>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

He realizes that the simplest way to do this is to introduce a new `notSoRed` style, since replacing the red value in the existing `danger` style would break the requirements for the `Notice` component.

He is a little reluctant to simply add a new spec, but there doesn't seem to be a better way to model this problem.  He double checks with the design team just to make sure:

> **Elliot**: "Hey folks, are we absolutely sure the `danger` color tone should differ across components?  It's <span style="color: red;"><code>red</code></span> in `Notice.danger` but <span style="color: #ff85c0;"><code>notSoRed</code></span> in `BigNotSoRedButton`.".
>
> **Design**: "Yeah we're sure, we've gotten feedback from users and let's go with what you have done here."

### Composition to the Rescue

Over the next few weeks, various additional requirements are placed on `Notice` and `BigNotSoRedButton`, and Elliot repeats the process of managing complexity by refactoring shareable code, only to find that he cannot avoid either:
1. Introducing new specs, or
2. Conditional-branching of applying shared logic

Note that the two points above are the inevitable precursors to complexity.

It occurred to him that the current state of the *reusable and abstracted* code is actually *more complex* than the duplicated but more *composable* approach presented below:

```js live
() => {
  const styles = {
    big: {
      fontSize: '32px',
      padding: '16px 32px',
    },
    danger: {
      backgroundColor: 'red',
      color: 'white'
    },
    warning: {
      backgroundColor: '#ffe7ba',
      color: '#ff7a45',
    },
    notSoRed: {
      backgroundColor: '#ff85c0',
      color: 'white',
    },
    notice: {
      borderRadius: '6px',
      border: '1px solid rgb(222, 225, 228)',
      fontSize: '14px',
      padding: '4px 16px',
    },
  };

  return (
    <Layout direction="column" spacing="l">
      <Element
        styles={[
          styles.notice,
          styles.big,
          styles.danger,
        ]}>
        Notice (Danger)
      </Element>
      <Element
        styles={[
          styles.notice,
          styles.warning,
        ]}>
        Notice (Warning)
      </Element>
      <Element
        as="button"
        styles={[
          styles.notSoRed,
          styles.big,
        ]}>
        BigNotSoRedButton
      </Element>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

A key thing to note here is that the conditional branching logic in style functions are now removed, in favor of pure composition of smaller style functions.  Elliot has yet again resolved and managed complexity!

### 409 Conflict

Although Elliot realized a discipline of composing functions will serve as a main way to combat complexity, he started noticing that the Complexity Beast always seems to be lurking *everytime* changes are made to the system.

Conflicted by his seemingly endless quest at managing complexity, he curiously asks the Design team an innocent question:

> **Elliot**: "Do we have a full understanding of what we are building?"
>
> **Design**: "Of course!"
>
> **Elliot**: "Where can I see a summary of the system of components we have built in the past few weeks?""
>
> **Design**: "They are in the mocks, docs, and these links."
>
> **Elliot**: "Is there a central place to see everything and how everything relates to each other?"
>
> **Design**: "No we don't have that.  We really need it too."

With the design resources sent to him, Elliot meticulously organizes the notes by date/domain/owner/etc.  The notes are obviously imperfect, and no amount of organization is able to fully describe the system he thought he had built over the weeks.

Over in another room, he overhears teammates arguing over the conflict on what the correct color of <code><span style="color: #ff85c0;">BigNotRedButton</span></code> should be.

### Goodbye Elliot

Elliot realizes that the source of complexity was never truly related to his implementation, nor by the decisions made the Design team.  At every point, everyone was doing their best and due dilligence in building a system that made sense.  He eventually came to a realization that the Complexity Beast was born out of the very decisions and choices made by everyone, on changes that made sense in a smaller timeframe and scope of the system, but not to the system as a whole because no one understood that in its entirety.

Understanding and coming to peace that the source of complexity is related to an imperfect knowledge of systems, Elliot finds renewed strength and begins thinking about how one might increase the transparency and accessibility of system knowledge.

The Design team did mention that *"We really need it too"*, he thought to himself.

### What went wrong?

In hindsight, it is easy to identify the mistakes that Elliot made technically (i.e. not favoring composition in earlier stages), but that would be disrespectful on our end to forget how well-intentioned Elliot had tried in writing just the minimal code that accurately satisfies requirements.  In fact, as we followed his journey, every choice he made was *thoughtful and reasonable* in relation to the scope of the problem presented to him.  Pre-optimizing and early abstractions can be argued to lead to more complexity since they don't solve the current problem meaningfully.

It is also tempting to assign blame to the Design team on not maintaining a source of truth.  Every team works with tools and sources of truth.  As engineers, we abstract and share code to create sources of truth, but we face the exact problems as the Design team does, which is system knowledge *always* trails behind changes and updates made to the system.  Unless there is a deliberate effort on our part to *systematically* build [system knowledge](#system-knowledge), our decisions will always be made on imperfect knowledge.

It is this very imperfect knowledge that fuels eventual complexity.  Without sufficient knowledge of the system, we make less ideal decisions that may introduce unintended complexity.  Any abstractions built on these decisions will then further propagate the complexity and misknowledge of the system for future contributors.

## System Knowledge

In the previous section, we observed how imperfect knowledge of systems creates inevitable complexity.  While building abstractions is important in reducing a system's complexity, it is important to note that:

> Building the wrong abstractions creates more complexity than duplication.

The next sections cover how [the Unix Philosophy](#the-unix-philosophy), and subsequently [the `uinix` philosophy](#the-uinix-philosophy), aid in improving system knowledge.

### The Unix philosophy

With Elliot's journey, we [learned](#a-few-weeks-later) that while we cannot avoid and conquer complexity, our most powerful tool is a careful and meaningful breakdown of programs into smaller composable parts.  What Elliot did was managing complexity using the Unix philosophy.

The [Unix philosophy][unix-philosophy] proposes minimalist and modular software development.  Unix programs tend to:
- do one thing and do it well.
- be inteoperable with other relating programs.
- are modular, composable, and extensible.

In relation to [system knowledge](#system-knowledge), by nature of their simplicity and interoperability, it is easy to study and understand higher forms of programs that are built with Unix programs.

### The `uinix` philosophy

The `uinix` philosophy is based on [the Unix philosophy](#the-unix-philosophy), and approaches all aspects of UI development by keeping programs small and interoperable.

Like Unix programs, `uinix` programs aim to:
- do one thing and do it well.
- be interoperable with other relating programs.
- are modular, composable, and extensible.

In relation to [system knowledge](#system-knowledge), the API surfaces of `uinix` programs are kept extremely small.

A detailed look at the `uinix` ecosytem of [packages][packages] will provide a brief overview on how the ecosystem approaches UI development with *small* opinionated sets of modular programs and patterns.

### `uinix` system specs

System specs and configurations in `uinix` are designed to serve as sources of truth, allowing access to system knowledge even in the absence of tooling.  The [`uinix-ui`][uinix-ui] UI system library is designed with this philosophy, and makes the UI system specs of `theme`, `icons`, `styles`, `typography` easily accessible even in its native serializable form.

Shown below are the actual `uinix-ui` system specs used to render this site and whitepaper:

#### `theme`
<pre>
  <code className="language-json">
    {JSON.stringify(theme, null, 2)}
  </code>
</pre>

#### `icons`
<pre>
  <code className="language-json">
    {JSON.stringify(icons, null, 2)}
  </code>
</pre>

#### `styles`
<pre>
  <code className="language-json">
    {JSON.stringify(styles, null, 2)}
  </code>
</pre>

#### `typography`
<pre>
  <code className="language-json">
    {JSON.stringify(typography, null, 2)}
  </code>
</pre>

These specs can also be rendered in more interactive ways that further improves our system knowledge through visual means, as shown in the following custom theme previewer.

<img src={themePreviewImage} width="100%" />

`uinix` specs, as shown above, are interoperable with each other, and together with a small set of just four interoperable and composable primitive components (`Element`, `Icon`, `Layout`, `Text`), the `uinix` philosophy allows building and composing complex UIs with ease, as detailed in the upcoming section.

### `uinix` systems

Visit https://systems.uinix.dev for a demo of UI systems built with [`uinix-ui`][uinix-ui].

The demos showcase popular web applications that are reverse-engineered into a *minimal* set of specs (`theme`, `icons`, `typography`, and `styles`), and built using just four component primitives (`Element`, `Layout`, `Icon`, and `Text`).

More importantly, the [system knowledge](#system-knowledge) of every UI system is easily and explicitly accessible.

## Conclusion

As we finally come to the closing section of this document, let us take some time to reflect on key points learned during our journey on managing complexity in UI systems.

- It remains important to always think of UI as a function of state i.e. [ui = f(s)](#ui--fs).
- Treatment of styles and CSS should be no different than treatment of regular functions.  We have learned a few techniques by simply emphasizing and thinking of style as a function of state i.e. [style = f(s)](#style--fs).
- [Design systems](#design-systems) and [UI systems](#ui-systems), while highly important in managing complexity in UI development, should be thought of no more as simply closed systems.
- We learned basic concepts and unavoidable truths about the [entropy](#entropy) and [complexity](#complexity) of closed systems.
- We followed the journey of [Elliot and the Complexity Beast](#elliot-and-the-complexity-beast) to gain a deeper understanding, through the use of a simple example, that complexity is unavoidable despite the well-intentioned choices we make.
- We learned that our choices that create complexity relate to imperfect [system knowledge](#system-knowledge), and seek appropriate remediations by applying [the Unix philosophy](#the-unix-philosophy).
- We provided a remediation that is more specific to UI systems, by introducing how [the `uinix` philosophy](#the-uinix-philosophy) allows building systems from interoperable primitives through composition, and an approach to making the underlying [system knowledge](#system-knowledge) easily accessible.

With final closing remarks, I hope that our journey with [UI systems and Complexity](#ui-systems-and-complexity) has made it clear on the truths that complexity can never be avoided.  As much as this fact may sound troubling, we now have a deeper understanding of the problem that was oftenly overlooked.  With a peace of what we cannot change, and an understanding of what we can change and improve, we gain a newfound respect for the systems we build, and own both our choices and complexity proudly.  Because, that is exactly the *story of software engineering* after all:

> A journey of understanding and building systems.
